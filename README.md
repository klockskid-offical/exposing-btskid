# Exposing BtPlayzX (btskid)
have you heard of Klockcraft? maybe not, but why would you anyway? <br>
it's a clout chasing project that doesn't actually work. <br>
According to btskid, the owner, and AR-SKID-1, it is a python rewrite with server support <br>
It was mostly ignored, until btskid stole [PeytonPlayz595](https://github.com/PeytonPlayz595/)'s [0.30-WebGL project](https://github.com/PeytonPlayz595/0.30-WebGL/) and blatantly skidded it, <br>
using Ctrl+F in classes.js and removing every reference to the original project and replacing it with "Klockcraft 0.30". (Stupid skid, he doesn't know that recompiling it will revert the changes and reveal that he stole it.)<br>
A few months later, he said **someone else** uploaded it, and framed him, but that's complete **BULLSHIT**. The commits were fucking authored by **HIM**.
